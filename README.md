Playfair-Encrypta
=================

A Playfair is a primitive—by modern reckoning—block cipher. It uses some principles common to modern computer block ciphers.

The algorithm used here is rather an extension of original playfair, developed by Charles Wheatstone.

To compile the program:
```
$ javac com/cprakashagr/cipher/playfair
```

To run the program:
```
$ java com.cprakashagr.cipher.UI
